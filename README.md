## Overview of Analysis
- The goal of the bikesharing analysis was to put together a number of visualizations drawn from Data based on a successful bike sharing business in NYC and apply these visualizations in a way that would help sway investors in to backing the idea of starting a bike sharing business in Des moines, Iowa. Of course we could not draw from all bikesharing Data in NYC, so we chose one company, and drew from the data generated in August 2019. The month of August was chosen stratigically, as it is a summer month and it was assumed it would be a busier month with a higher rate of bike riders. Which would ultimately provide a larger data set to draw conclusions from. 

- the analysis focused on certain aspects of the data set more than others. We really wanted to focus on who would be using our bike sharing service, when would they be using it, and how long would their trips be. Using the data set I beleive we were able to address these questions with in depth visualizations that take in to consideration the type of user ( customer/ subscriber ), the gender of our perceived user ( Male/ Femail/ Unknown ), the time frames with which each respected user type is likely to use our service, and the length of each type of users trip.
